The identity plays off the contrast between old-world craft and urban energy. The logo is a custom bread tag, symbolizing everyday familiarity reimagined. It’s iconic, minimal, and instantly recognizable—evoking freshness, utility, and nostalgia all at once. </p>
                        
                        <p>There are 4 locations: Soho, East Village, Bushwick, and Brooklyn. I've created a bread tag design for each, naming the crossroads on the top half.

Chocolate brown grounds the brand, echoing the warmth of a crisp crust and neighborhood bakeries. </p>
                        
                        <p>I was originally assigned to design a carefully crafted paper bag featuring a custom logo. From that starting point, I developed BreadHaus.

        <h3>Project summary</h3>
        
            <p> BreadHaus is an artisan bread brand born in New York City, blending modern design with the soul of the city. The identity plays off the contrast between old-world craft and urban energy. The logo is a custom bread tag, symbolizing everyday familiarity reimagined. It’s iconic, minimal, and instantly recognizable—evoking freshness, utility, and nostalgia all at once. </p>
            
            <p>There are 4 locations: Soho, East Village, Bushwick, and Brooklyn. I've created a bread tag design for each, naming the crossroads on the top half. When you make a purchase, you will receive a bag to carry your bread which has been thoughtfully designed. Hanging from one of the handles is a location-specific tag—a tactile detail that connects each loaf to the neighborhood it came from, making every visit feel personal and place-based. </p>
            
            <p>The main color palette pairs are chartreuse and chocolate brown. The secondary colors are lighter and muted tones of each. Chartreuse adds a jolt of vibrancy, reflecting NYC’s constant motion and edge. Chocolate brown grounds the brand, echoing the warmth of a crisp crust and neighborhood bakeries. </p>
            
            <p>I was originally assigned to design a carefully crafted paper bag featuring a custom logo. From that starting point, I developed BreadHaus. Pushing beyond the brief, I expanded the identity system to include eight unique posters and flyers, designed for promotion on the streets of NYC.  </p>
